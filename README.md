# TacticsKitUnity3D


_This project uses the [Animated Spartan King](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/1735) by [bshgame](https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/search/page=1/sortby=popularity/query=publisher:645), found at the Unity Asset Store_


Warning: This project was uploaded recently, but it was actually developed circa 2015, with what is now a very old version of Unity. I decided to upload it here on Github because I liked what I had achieved back then, specially since editor extensions were never that well documented, but because of its age it's possible there are deprecated and incompatible code present in this repository.
